# C++ string lib in C
## Introduction
### why?
Because I want to prototype my softwares very fast and C strings are error-prone.

## Compilation
### Included tests
```
make string
make test
// make clean
```
### In your projects
Just copy/paste string.c and string.h into your project and compile it normally

## Performances
Performances are suboptimal, safety and implementation simplicity are the main focus.

## Status
I don't plan on implementing every C++ string functions
